So this is going to be a paper trail for how the code was created so that when I come back to this years 
later I can remember what was done

This will just be a list of how things have been done

* Created the Game processing loop
* Created the map
* got player movement
* tried out tile interaction
* generated a Default Map
* created Loading of the Maps
* created rudimentary Vision field
* Created Saving
* Created Game Start Up Menu
* Created A way to load Desired Map
* Modified Saving
* Got the player to interact with doors
* Got fail safe on drawing tiles with no images
* Got diagonal looks
* created Item Class
* created Inventory Class
* created a Key to open a door
* got the key to open the door
* Got the immediate vision system to work. Still need the player memeory to work
* Determined that the immediate vision system is only partially done. The system still needs to have some cases accounted for.
* Finished the immediate visions system
* got the Character Memory to work for one map only. Still need to get the player to save his memory of the level.
* got the Inventory of the Character to show up on the screen. Will need to personalize the screen for the game. For now using the default system
* fixed the system so that it will generate proper empty maps. Just realized that each entity will try and load a map for its self. That will be complicated I think
